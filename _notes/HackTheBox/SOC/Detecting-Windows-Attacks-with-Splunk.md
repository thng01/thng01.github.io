# Detecting Windows Attacks with Splunk

Hi, I'm thng01, a soon graduate student currently building my skills in cybersecurity. 



I created this note to document my journey, revise what Iâ€™ve learned, and share detailed write-ups of HTB SOC Job Path. My goal is to strengthen my investigation, detection, and analysis skills while preparing for my career in a Security Operations Center.



### Detecting Common User/Domain Recon

Active Directory Domain Reconnaissance is a indispensable step during an cyberattack lifecycle, as to determine the architecture, network as well as potential victims.



There are some native executables to perform AD reconnaissance:

*  **net group** cmd: can be used to list "Domain Admins" in domain
* **whoami /all**
* **wmic computersystem get domain**
* **net user /domain**
* **net group "Domain Admins" /domain**
* **arp -a**
* **nltest /domain_trusts**

These commands can be an indicator of an attack.

Or, there is a set of tools specialised for this job:  BloodHound/SharpHound\

* BloodHound: open-source tool for analyse and visualize AD to clarify trust relationships, permissions, group memberships in AD environment
* Sharphound: a C# data collector for BloodHound



So how can we detect these actions?

As any other reconnaissance tool, this one executes several LDAP queries to the DC to gather info about the domain. However Windows Event Logs does not record LDAP queries. There are other options like:

* Windows ETW **Microsoft-Windows-LDAP-Client** provider: quick, efficient and Yara-compatible ([Useful list of LDAP filter for reconnaissance tools](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefenderatpblog/hunting-for-reconnaissance-activities-using-ldap-search-filters/824726))
* Splunk: Which we are gonna focus on 

We can detect recon base on those 2 approaches.

Questions:

Here is the Splunk search given. This is a detection base on targeting BloodHound

```spl
index=main earliest=1690195896 latest=1690285475 source="WinEventLog:SilkService-Log"
| spath input=Message 
| rename XmlEventData.* as * 
| table _time, ComputerName, ProcessName, ProcessId, DistinguishedName, SearchFilter
| sort 0 _time
| search SearchFilter="*(samAccountType=805306368)*"
| stats min(_time) as _time, max(_time) as maxTime, count, values(SearchFilter) as SearchFilter by ComputerName, ProcessName, ProcessId
| where count > 10
| convert ctime(maxTime)
```

The task requires us : All time, all process with LDAP queries and filter for samAccountType. So here is what I did:

1. Set time to All time
2. Lower the count to 1 to get more process
3. Add stats for Processname (optional)

The answer is a process that is very familiar throughout the module.
